ABSTRACT :-
This project describes the creation of a prosthetic arm for amputees that uses an EMG sensor. The project entails attaching EMG electrodes to the residual limb of the amputee in order to monitor muscle signals, which are then utilized to regulate the motor movement of the prosthetic arm to bend the fingers.
The prosthetic arm's design, manufacture, and testing, which also shows how it has the potential to improve amputees' quality of life by offering a practical method of hand movement.
